🚀 5 Beginner-Level Polyfill Problems

✅ Implement polyfills for basic array methods and object methods.

    Polyfill for map()
    Polyfill for filter()
    Polyfill for reduce()
    Polyfill for forEach()
    Polyfill for some() and every()

⚡ 5 Intermediate-Level Polyfill Problems

✅ Implement polyfills for advanced array and object methods.

    Polyfill for find()
    Polyfill for findIndex()
    Polyfill for flat()
    Polyfill for bind()
    Polyfill for Object.assign()

🔥 5 Advanced-Level Polyfill Problems

✅ Implement polyfills for asynchronous and event-driven JavaScript concepts.

    Polyfill for Promise.all()
    Polyfill for Promise.race()
    Polyfill for debounce() (Used in search input optimization)
    Polyfill for throttle() (Used in scroll and resize optimization)
    Polyfill for setTimeout() and setInterval()

🎯 Bonus Challenge (Super Advanced)

✅ Implement polyfills for complex JavaScript internals.

    Polyfill for call() and apply()
    Polyfill for localStorage and sessionStorage
    Polyfill for JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()
    Polyfill for EventEmitter (custom event handling)
    Polyfill for async/await using Generators

🚀 How to Practice?

✅ Follow a structured approach → Start with array methods → Move to objects → Then promises & async.
✅ Write test cases for your polyfills using sample inputs and compare with native implementations.
✅ Analyze performance & edge cases (like empty arrays, null values, etc.).
✅ Try implementing without looking at the solution first.
⏳ Time Required to Master Polyfills?

    Beginner → 1 week (if you do 2-3 problems per day)
    Intermediate → 1-2 weeks (depending on depth of understanding)
    Advanced → 2-3 weeks (since Promises, debounce, throttle are tricky)

If you solve all 20 polyfills, you will have a deep understanding of JavaScript internals and be ready for FAANG-level interviews. 🚀💡
